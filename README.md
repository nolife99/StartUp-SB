# StartUp-SB

solo storyboard project by me

my storyboard for this [map:](http://osu.ppy.sh/b/1803623)
reuploaded to this [map:](http://osu.ppy.sh/b/3683586)

requires [storybrew](https://github.com/Damnae/storybrew) to run

# Notes:

- used Action<> delegate to reduce sprite usage, easier OsbSpritePool usage, and not use new OsbSprite
- used #region to decrease my messiness
- used a input lyrics file for instant update and for timing reasons
