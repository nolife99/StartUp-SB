# StartUp-SB

solo storyboard project by me

my storyboard for this map: http://osu.ppy.sh/b/1803623
reuploaded to this map: http://osu.ppy.sh/b/3683586

requires storybrew to run

notes:

lyrics script exports unused lyrics (can't find fix)

used Action<T> delegate to reduce sprite usage, easier OsbSpritePool usage, and not use new OsbSprite

used #region to decrease my messiness

used a input lyrics file for instant update and for timing reasons (thx Apis035)
